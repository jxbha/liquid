# bin/ 

## Overview
Meant for environment scripts and utilities.

This sort of uses a **dispatch pattern**, where we create our subshell, which adds dispatch.sh to PATH. We then use dispatch.sh to call the rest of our scripts as necessary. I usually alias it to `ds` because it's WASD-reachable and tab auto-complete suggests DISPLAY on Linux.

As an example, from the project root...

1. Create the project subshell:

        ./bin/envsetup

2. Run dispatch.sh with various commands

    Usage: dispatch.sh <command> [options]

    Available options:
        help               You are here.
        bootstrap          Bootstrap various environments.
        decrypt            Decrypts all secrets in the project.
        encrypt            Encrypts all secrets in the project.
        certs              Create necessary self-signed certificates.
        registry           Prepare registry with images from podman.
        containers         Pull all necessary container images
        images             Check current images in cluster registry.
        image              Check tags for provided image.
        assets             Downloads all third-party resources for Kubernetes.
        resetvol           Resets directories for persistent volumes. Hacky but temporary.

Arguments in subscripts are included in dispatch.sh using bash's builtin `shift`.
